## Business Activities:

* What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?
The company is trying to bring REIT - Real Estate Investing to the masses, before Fundrise, REIT was only for the most experienced in the Real Estate market and or upper middle class individual that can afford $$$ to make such investment.
Everyone knows that REIT are expensive, Fundrise has be able to reach a much larger market otherwise by allowing relatively smaller amount of investment from as many qualified investors as possible.
The  main reason for the company is to enable the average investor to make a Real Estate investment without lots of money and connection. 
Which at the time is a revoluntionary idea, because we had just come at the tail end of the 2008 Recession and more have lost their homes and others were also interested in investing and making more money during the downturn

* Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?
A qualifying investor is an eighteen year old American or permanent resident. So far the company operates in the United States.

*What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)
In 2015, the company launched their online REIT (Real Estate Investment) eREIT. At this point they are the biggest name recognition in the eREIT space and that bring them credibilty and value.

* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing–– you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)
By May 2014, the company was able to report a $15 million investments involoving 1000+ investors. As of today the company is claiming to have invested $4.9B in the United States Real Estate market.

## Landscape:

They are primarily in the Real Estate Investment domain, REIT.

* What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5-10 years?
It is growing rapidly and making it a major competitor in the investment space, rivaling bonds, stocks and mutual funds investments to name a few. 

* What are the other major companies in this domain?
Other major companies include Vanguard and Fidelity. Because Fundrise original idea of allowing low, middle and high investment options, other companies in the Real Estate in both residential and commercial space are : Jamestowninvest, Patch of Land, RealtyShares, Peerstreet and Realty Mogul. 

## Results

* What has been the business impact of this company so far?
It has and still is revolutionary in its space, even though there are numerous other companies that are doing the same thing now. Fundrise has been able to dominate this space and has the name recognition and and value to be a formidable company for the foreseeable future.
At this point the company claimed to have 130k investors, $4.9 invested, $79M Net Dividendd earned and an average of 8-12 Annual Returns. These numbers showed us a very healthy and vibrant company.

* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing, based on these metrics?
Currently Fundrise is a privately held company and one core measurement is the amount of capital they are able to raise in the private space and the  Real Estate projects they are involved in, as the numbers listed above. 

* How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain?
By their comparism, they are leading in REIT as compared to Vanguard. Their dividend yeild is at 4.65% where as Vanguard is at 3.11%



## Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)
They were able to bring a novel idea into the REIT and make it main stream. However,  I would like to see them offer more product and less restrictions.
Currently they have minimum of $500 for online investment (doable for many people). However, they have a restrictions that makes it less attractive for some beginning investors. Once you have invested it is hard to get your cash back, which makes it difficult for investors to commit. They can allow investors to manage 

* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?
If are ready to make long term investement between 5-7 years, then this is a good opportunity, because even though you receive quarterly reports and or dividend, you will not be able to pull out your original investment until after 5-7 years. 

* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?
Block Chain, Algorithm 

* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?
Block Chain is one of the safest investment options out there. This is will give investors peace of mind by being able to see exactly which projects, buildings or research thier funds are being allocated to. This builds more trust from their investors as the process is transparent for them.
